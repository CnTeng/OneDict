## Architecture

The project follows a clean service-oriented architecture:

- `src/common/` - Shared types, constants, and cross-runtime utilities.
- `src/platforms/` - Platform entrypoints, manifests, and packaged assets.
- `src/services/` - Service implementations (Config, Anki, Dictionary, platform adapters).
